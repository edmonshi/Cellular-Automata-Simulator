### FAQ
>1. Where can I find instructions to use the app?
* Inside the application there is a help menu in the toolbar.
>2. Where are my render folders?
* They should be found inside the root directory of the application.
>3. What the scaling, why can I not see the points on 1x scaling?
* The scaling is based on pixels, so if your monitor is high resolution (ex. 4k), try using a larger scaling factor. This will also reduce cpu usage.
